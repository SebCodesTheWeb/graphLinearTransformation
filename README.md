# graphLinearTransformation
Visualising Linear Transformations on Polynomials
View the Deployed Project Here: https://linear-transformation.netlify.app/

##(Note: This is just a quick fun prototype to apply what I've learned from linear algebra and matrices)

##To use:
1. Input any polonymial in the field y = () | Use the form a * x and x**b, ax and x^b does not work!
2. Click on "draw"
3. Then input a matrix under ex and ey. Input first the x-coordinate and the the y-coordinate. Transformations for scaling seem to work well, skewing and rotations seem to have some problems.
4. Click on "apply linear transformation".

If everthing went right you should now see two graphs, and now you can very easily visualize the linear transformation.



##This program is far from functional, I just wanted to play around, I might continue working on this project later on and start adding animations, take in multiple forms av functions and make the whole app more enteprise like Geogebra.
